# Instapods GraphQL API Spec
This doc outlines the behaviors that drive the client-server specification. This doc will not be outlined by separation of GQL queries vs mutations. Instead, it will follow typical user workflows. This helps us mentally model a spec closer to real user behavior, which is the point of GQL.

This doc will also reference Firebase CloudFN triggers, which you can see the spec for at `firebase-cloud-functions/functions/README.md`

This doc will also reference Firestore DB Models, which you can see the spec for at `firebase-cloud-firestore/src/README.md`
